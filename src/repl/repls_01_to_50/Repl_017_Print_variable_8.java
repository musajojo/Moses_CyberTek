017. Print variable 8
Instructions from your teacher:

2 String variables are already declared and assigned values.
They will hold different programming language names.

Using those variables print the message exactly like below.

Ex:
Assume lan1 = "Java" and lan2 = "SQL"

You need to print exactly:

I will learn "Java" and "SQL" at CybertekSchool.
