Instructions from your teacher:

You have 2 words, both of them have 3 characters.
If either of them does not have exactly 3 characters, print "cannot merge"
Merge their characters one by one and print together like below:

aok

by inserting +""+ (empty string) between chars,
you can concatenate char values.
